# Neopets-Magma-Pool-Time-Checker
Overview: this is a script that will check the Neopets magma pool every 5 minutes and log your magma pool time.
I made this to practice using Selenium, and to fulfill a childhood idea for a program. 

Requirements: Selenium

Details: neopets_magma_check.py will check the neopets magma pool every 5 minutes and log your magma
bath time.  The results of every check are logged with timestamps to magmaLog.txt.  A screenshot will be taken of your
magma bath time when it is detected.

DISCLAIMER: Scripts of any kind are against the Neopets terms of service.  I do not endorse the usage of this script on the Neopets website, though it would theoritically work and has theoritically been tested and shown to work.

Theoretically, of course. ;)
